Structured Query Language (SQL)
Not only Structured Query Language (NoSQL) 

SQL:
Data stored in tables (rows and columns)
Ex. A users table with columns like name, password, email.

SQL databases are also known as "relational" databases.
They excel at forming relationships between tables.

Multiple blog posts can be linked to a single user record.
Allows efficient data retrieval using SQL.

Ex. Adding "favorite food" field for only one user.

Uses JSON-like documents, Key-value pairs.

Advantages of NoSQL:
Flexibility in data structure.
Easier modification of data on the fly.
Addresses pains of SQL, especially inflexibility in data structure.

Popular NoSQL Databases: MongoDB, Redis, DynamoDB.
